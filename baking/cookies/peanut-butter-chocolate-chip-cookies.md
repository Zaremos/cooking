## Steps

Mix the sugar, brown sugar and butter in a bowl until it becomes porous. Mix in the water, egg and peanut butter and stir until it becomes smooth.

Mix flour, vanilla sugar, salt and bicarbonate and stir into the previous mix.

Add in the oats and dark chocolate and mix evenly.

Prepare one or two pans for the oven with sheets of baking paper.

Take a large spoon of the dough and put it on the baking paper. Press it into a round cookie shape using your hand.

> If you want to add a filling to the cookies see the extra instructions under `Variation` further down.

Heat the oven to 165 C and put in your sheets of cookies for 12-15 minutes depending on the thickness of your cookies.

Leave on the pans to cool off and then remove them from the pan in order to dry completely (the bottom tens to be a bit sticky still).

## Variations

These cookies are perfectly good as they are but you can add a filling if you want to.

In order to do this you make the cookies a bit thinner add about a tea spoon worth of filing on top of it. You then make a small patch of dough that you place on top of the cookie and seal the edges by pressing them together. This seals in the filling and creates a nice and chunky cookie.
